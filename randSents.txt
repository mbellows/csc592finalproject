I went for a walk with my dog. There were no clouds in the sky and the weather was quite warm. After the walk, I did my homework and then went to bed. Today, I am going to go to the store. I will buy some milk and eggs. The dog eats all the eggs even though it makes him sick. This dog is very strange. I think I should get a cat instead and sell the dog. Cats are weird too so maybe it is not a good idea. I will sleep on it. I will sleep on it. I will sleep on it. I will sleep on it. I will sleep on it.
